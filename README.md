<h1> Advent of Code - deJilz </h1>

Recently, I discovered the <a href="https://www.adventofcode.com">Advent of Code</a> event. This repo contains success solutions for at least one part (hopefully two).

Also, this repo is my first. It will be testing grounds for some things and shouldn't be taken too seriously. All in good fun.
