<h1> Advent of Code - deJilz </h1>

Recently, I discovered the <a href="https://www.adventofcode.com">Advent of Code</a> event. This repo contains my attempts, some inputs, and other helpful files I use.

This repo is also the first one I have made. It will be testing grounds for some things and shouldn't be taken too seriously. All in good fun.
